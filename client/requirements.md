## Notes
- Images will be handled via external URLs or placeholders for now as no upload endpoint was explicitly detailed in the prompt, but the schema has `imageUrl` fields. I will use Unsplash placeholders.
- The app has two distinct user roles: Client and Artist. I'll need to handle role-based redirection in the dashboard.
- Authentication is handled via Replit Auth (setup in backend).
